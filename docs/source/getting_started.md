## Getting Started

We recommend to start with the [main demo]() to learn how the library works and how to use its features.

Motivation behind this library is to act as a one stop solution for research on Training Dynamics of Neural Networks, which is one of the most important topics in Mechanistic Interpretability and AI Interpretability in general.

This library is heavily insipired by the early work done by [Michael Hu](https://michahu.github.io/) for the paper [Latent State Models of Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09543).

### Installation

```
pip install visualizing-training
```
